# 🌐 Full Stack Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Full Stack Development Journey** repository! 🚀  
This repo documents my path as I learn **frontend, backend, and full stack development**, with step-by-step progress, examples, and notes.  

Whether you’re a beginner or someone brushing up on concepts, you’ll find structured content here to learn **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Databases, and modern frameworks**.

---

## 📅 About This Repository
The purpose of this repo is to **learn, practice, and showcase** full stack development concepts.  
It is organized in a way where you can follow along from **beginner-friendly basics** to **professional-level projects**.

I will be committing regularly, covering **theory + practical examples + small projects**.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap
Here’s the structured roadmap I’ll follow:

### 1. **Frontend (Client-Side)**
- HTML Basics → Structure, Elements, Forms  
- CSS → Styling, Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design  
- JavaScript → Syntax, DOM, Events, Functions, ES6+ Features  
- Advanced JS → Asynchronous JS (Promises, Async/Await), Fetch API  
- Frameworks (later) → React.js (optional but powerful)

### 2. **Backend (Server-Side)**
- Node.js Basics → Setup, Modules, File Handling  
- NPM → Package management  
- Express.js → Routing, Middleware, APIs  
- Authentication & Authorization → JWT, Sessions  
- REST APIs → CRUD Operations, API Development  

### 3. **Databases**
- Relational Databases → MySQL / PostgreSQL (SQL basics, queries)  
- NoSQL Databases → MongoDB (documents, collections, queries)  

### 4. **Full Stack Integration**
- Connecting Frontend ↔ Backend  
- Using APIs in frontend apps  
- Building small full stack projects  

### 5. **Mini Projects**
- To-Do List (Frontend only → then with Backend)  
- Notes App (with Database)  
- Blog Application (Full Stack CRUD)  
- Authentication System
